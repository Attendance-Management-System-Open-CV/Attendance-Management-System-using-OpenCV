# Attendance-Management-System-using-OpenCV
This repository contains the code and the steps for the implementation of attendance management system using open CV.

## Project Description

The Attendance Management System is a Python-based application that uses OpenCV for face recognition to record attendance. This project simplifies the attendance tracking process by automating the task using facial recognition technology.
